# Tutorial: Get Started with Entity Framework 6 Code First using MVC 5

----
## I. Introduction
See [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application?fbclid=IwAR3TBR9q1uYdzWZQRjk6cNsdUout3tdfBIoUI7OY_k4FHPbo7XEpB-AY9dod)

This guide is supported by Microsoft and through Mr.Vinh's introduction gave me the opportunity to experience and learn and learn how to build an ASP.NET MVC 5 application using Entity Framework 6 for query data. This tutorial uses Code First workflow. For information and how to calculate with the first code, the first Database, and the first Model.
This tutorial series explains how to build the Contoso University sample application. The sample application is a simple university website. With it, you can view and update student, course, and instructor information.
